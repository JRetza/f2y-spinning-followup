\subsection{prior constraints on spin}
\label{subsec:prior_constraints}

Since spin is largely degenerate with mass ratio, and spin is expected to be small for BNS sources, it is interesting to ask how the mass constraints are affected by making stonger prior assumptions about the spin of NSs.  First, we make the extreme assumption that NSs have negligible spin, as was done in \citet{Singer_2014}.  Figure \ref{fig:mass_std} compares the distribution of (fractional) uncertainties in chirp-mass and mass-ratio estimates for the spinning and non-spinning analyses.\footnote{We only show results from the TaylorF2 non-spinning analyses, but we also ran SpinTaylorT4 analyses with spins fixed to $\chi_{1,~2}=0$ and validated that systematic differences in waveform models do not significantly affect estimates. There were no significant differences in parameter estimation between the non-spinning TaylorF2 and zero-spin SpinTaylorT4 results for any of the quantities we examined.} The average fractional uncertainty in chirp mass and mass ratio is $0.0185\%$ and $8.93\%$, respectively, both being a factor of a few smaller than the uncertainties from a spinning analysis.
