\subsection{prior constraints on spin}
\label{subsec:prior_constraints}

Since spin is largely degenerate with mass ratio, and spin is expected to be small for BNS sources, it is interesting to ask how the mass constraints are affected by making stonger prior assumptions about the spin of NSs.  First, we make the extreme assumption that NSs have negligible spin, as was done in \citet{Singer_2014}.  Figure \ref{fig:mass_std} compares the distribution of uncertainties in chirp-mass and mass-ratio estimates for the spinning, and the two non-spinning analyses.  The consistency between the non-spinning analyses using different waveform families shows that the drastic increases in the uncertainty of mass parameters from the spinning analysis is due to degeneracies with spin, and not systematic differences between the SpinTaylorT4 and TaylorF2 waveform families.
