Inspiraling binary neutron stars are expected to be the main source of gravitational-wave signals for the new generation of advanced ground-based detectors. Advanced LIGO will begin operation in 2015 and we investigate how well we could hope to measure properties of these binaries should a detection be made in the first observing period. To measure the masses and spins of the neutron stars accurately, it is essential to include the spins in the parameter estimation analysis. This makes parameter estimation more computationally expensive. Considering an astrophysically motivated population of sources, we find that the masses and spins are \ldots Even though our population is only slowly rotating, the mass--spin degeneracy impacts our results. However, extrinsic parameters, specifically the sky position and luminosity distance, and not influenced by the inclusion of spin; therefore, less computationally expensive results calculated neglecting spin can be used with impunity for electromagnetic follow-up.
