\section{Sky localization}

Having discussed how GW observations can measure the intrinsic properties of their source systems, we now consider the measurement of extrinsic parameters such as source location. On their own, these are not useful for understanding the physcis of compact objects, but they are central to the success of multimessenger astronomy.
