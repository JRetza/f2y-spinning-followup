\subsection{Distance}\label{sec:distance}

We quantify distance measurement accuracy using symmetric credible intervals: the distance credible interval $\mathrm{CI}_p^{D}$ in the range that contains the central $p$ of the integrated posterior, with $(1-p)/2$ falling both above and below the limits \citep{Aasi_2013}.
