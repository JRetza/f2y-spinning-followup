\subsection{Luminosity distance}\label{sec:distance}

The distance is more likely than the sky position to show the imprint of the spin. The distance is degenerate with the inclination, and the inclination can be better constrained for precessing systems. Since we are considering a population with low spins, precession is minimal, and there should be little effect including spin in the analysis.

We quantify distance measurement accuracy using symmetric credible intervals: the distance credible interval $\mathrm{CI}_p^{D}$ in the range that contains the central $p$ of the integrated posterior, with $(1-p)/2$ falling both above and below the limits \citep{Aasi_2013}. The absolute size of the credible interval scales with the distance, hence we divide the credible interval by the true (injected) distance $D_\star$ this gives an approximate analogue of twice the fractional uncertainty \citep{Berry_2014}. The cumulative distribution of the scaled credible intervals are plotted in figure \ref{fig:dist}. There is negligible difference between the spinning and nonspinning analyses.
