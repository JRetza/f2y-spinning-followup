\subsection{Mass Estimates}\label{sec:mass}
To sample efficiently, waveform models are parameterized to reduce degeneracies between parameters as much as possible.  To leading order, the post-Newtonian expansion of the waveform's phase evolution depends on the \emph{chirp mass} $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c} = (m_1 m_2)^{3/5} (m_1 + m_2)^{-1/5}$, making it a \emph{very} well constrained parameterization of binary mass.  The remaining mass parameter used is the mass ratio $q = m_2/m_1$, where $0 < q \leq 1$.  Detectors are much less sensitive to the mass ratio, and strong degeneracies with spin make constraints on $q$ even worse \citep{Cutler_1994}.  It is primarily the uncertainty in $q$ that governs the uncertainty in component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.

Figure \ref{fig:mass_pdfs} shows the superimposed, one-dimensional marginal posterior PDFs and cumulative density functions (CDFs) for the chirp mass (centered on each mean) and mass ratio for all $250$ events.  Also shown are the PDFs and CDFs averaged over all $250$ posteriors. Chirp-mass estimates are typically approximately normally distributed about the mean, while mass ratio estimates have support across most of the prior range.

From these one-dimensional PDFs we extract the standard deviations as point estimates of parameter uncertainties.  Figure \ref{fig:mass_std_snr} shows the distribution of chirp-mass and mass-ratio uncertainties, with colors corresponding to the S/N measured by the detection pipeline. On average, chirp mass is recovered with a standard deviation of $8.6 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and mass ratio $0.18$, with both generally increasing as S/N decreases.
