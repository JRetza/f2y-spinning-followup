Prior assumptions about spin can affect mass estimates.  By discarding posterior samples above a given spin, we can effectively make stronger prior assumptions to see how mass estimates are affected.  Figure \ref{fig:restricted_priors} shows the average posterior mass-ratio PDFs for maximum spins of $\chi < \{1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0\}$.  $\chi<1$ and $\chi<0$ correspond to the spinning and non-spinning analyses looked at thus far.  $\chi<0.7$ is constistent with the NSs remaining entact based on proposed equations-of-state.  $\chi<0.4$ is constistent with the spin of observed, isolated NSs to date.  $\chi<0.2$ and $\chi<0.1$ are arbitrarely chosen to show the evolution of the PDF toward the non-spinning case.

From these PDFs, it is clear that \emph{very} strong prior constraints have to be placed in order to have measurable effects on mass estimates. One could argue whether prior constraints on spin should be consistent with the observed NS population, or theoretical EOS predictions.  The main argument against using the most conservative assumpions is that this could limit mass constraints.  However, figure \ref{fig:restricted_priors} shows that even extending the prior well above the break-up limit does have a significant impact on mass constraints if the NS population turns out to be slowly-spinning.
