By discarding posterior samples above a given spin, we can effectively make stronger prior assumptions about the maximum spin of NSs to see how mass estimates are affected.  Figure \ref{fig:restricted_priors} shows the cumulative distribution of lower $90\%$ bounds on the estimates of $m_2$ of the 250 simulated sources for spin priors of $\chi_{1,~2} \leq \{1, 0.7, 0.4, 0\}$.  $\chi_{1,~2}<1$ and $\chi_{1,~2}=0$ correspond to the spinning and non-spinning analyses looked at thus far.  $\chi<0.7$ is consistent with the NSs remaining intact for most proposed non-exotic EOSs.  $\chi<0.4$ is consistent with the spin of observed, isolated NSs to date.

From these PDFs, it is clear that \emph{very} strong prior assumptions are required to have measurable effects on mass estimates. Assuming NSs to be spinning with $\chi_{1,~2}\leq .4$ a priori only constrains masses by an extra few percent compared to allowing them to have $\chi_{1,~2} \leq 1$.
