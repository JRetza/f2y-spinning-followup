\section{Spinning Analysis}

\citet{2013arXiv1304.0670L} details the detection, low-latency localization, and `medium-latency' follow-up of the simulated signals in 2015.  Missing from the study is the full characterization of the source, accounting for spin.  The population chosen to be simulated for these studies, with spin magnitudes $\chi < 0.05$, have small enough spins that biases in parameter estimates due to assuming the components to be non-spinning are well below the statistical uncertainty (CITATION NEEDED).  This choice was motivated by the charactistics of neutron stars found in BNS systems to date, however nuetron stars \emph{outside} of BNS systems have been observed with spins as high as $\chi = 0.4$ \cite{Hessels_2006,Brown_2012}, and depending on the NS equation-of-state could have spins as high as $\chi \lesssim 0.7$ \cite{Lo_2011}.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe and justify priors
\item Define waveform family
\item Give mass, spin, tilt, etc. measurement distributions
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Comparison against non-spinning analsis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show how mass estimates compare.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Restricting Spin Priors}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivate restricting spin magnitude for NSs
\item Show spin must be \textit{very} restricted to affect mass estimates.
\end{enumerate}
