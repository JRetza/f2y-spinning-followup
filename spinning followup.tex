\section{Spinning Analysis}
\label{sec:spin}

\citet{Singer_2014} details the detection, low-latency localization, and medium-latency (i.e. non-spinning) follow-up of the simulated signals in 2015. In this work we perform the expensive task of full parameter estimation that accounts for non-zero compact-object spin. Whereas \citet{Singer_2014} used the (non-spinning) TaylorF2 waveform model, we make use of the SpinTaylorT4 waveform model \citep{Buonanno_2003,Buonanno_2009}, parameterized by the fifteen parameters that uniquely define a circularized compact binary inspiral.

The simulated population of BNS systems contains slowly spinning NSs, with masses between $1.2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $1.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and spin magnitudes $\chi < 0.05$.  This choice was motivated by the characteristics of NSs found thus far in Galactic BNS systems expected to merge within a Hubble time through GW emission. However, neutron stars \emph{outside} of BNS systems have been observed with spins as high as $\chi = 0.4$ \citep{Hessels_2006,Brown_2012}, and depending on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) could theoretically have spins as high as $\chi \lesssim 0.7$ \citep{Lo_2011} without breaking up.  For these reasons, the prior assumptions used for Bayesian inference of source parameters are more broad than the spin range of the simulated source population.

To simulate a real analysis scenario where the class of compact binary and the NS EOS are not known, we use uniform priors in component masses between $0.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $5.0~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to avoid any prior constraints on mass posteriors, and our standard spin prior: uniform in spin magnitudes $\chi_{1,\,2} \sim U(0, 1)$ and isotropic in spin orientation. Prior distributions for the location and orientation of the binary match that of the simulated population, i.e. uniform in volume (out to a maximum distance of $218.9~\mathrm{Mpc}$, safely outside the detection horizon, which is $\sim137~\mathrm{Mpc}$ for a $1.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$--$1.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ binary) and isotropically oriented.  Choosing any particular upper bound for spin magnitude would require either assuming hard constraints on NS spin-up, which are based upon observations with hard-to-quantify selection effects, or making assumptions regarding the unknown EOS of NSs. For these reasons we choose not to rule out compact objects with high spin a priori by using an upper limit of $\chi < 1$, encompassing all allowed NS and black hole (BH) spins.  In section \ref{subsec:prior_constraints} we look at more constraining spin priors, and particularly how such choices can affect mass estimates.
