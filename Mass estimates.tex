For the sake of efficiency, it is common to reparameterize the model to reduce the degeneracy between parameters, particularly those specifing the binary's masses.  GW detectors are most sensitive to a combination of component masses referred to as the chirp mass, $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c} = (m_1 m_2)^{3/5} (m_1 + m_2)^{-1/5}$.  For this study, we use the assymetric mass ratio $q = m_2/m_1$ as the second mass parameter, where $m_2 < m_1$ such that $0 < q < 1$.  Detectors are much less sensitive to the mass ratio, and it is uncertainty in $q$ that governs the uncertainty in component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.
