Figure \ref{fig:mass_std} shows the distribution of mass standard deviations for the 250 simulated signals from the three analyses previously described.  The consistency between the non-spinning analyses shows that the drastic increases in the uncertainty of mass parameters from the spinning analysis is due purely to degeneracies with spin, and not systematic difference between waveform families.

Figure \ref{fig:mass_pdfs} shows the chirp mass and mass ratio marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative probability density functions (CDFs) for all 250 spinning analyses.  The average over all PDFs and CDFs are also shown.  The chirp mass distributions were each centered on the mean of the distribution, demostrating that all chirp mass PDFs are unimodal with similar shape.  The mass ratio distributions however, have larger varaice, and span across most of the prior range.
