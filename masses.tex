Figure \ref{fig:mass_pdfs} shows the chirp mass and mass ratio marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative probability density functions (CDFs) for all 250 spinning analyses.  The average over all PDFs and CDFs are also shown.  The chirp mass distributions were each centered on the mean of the distribution, demostrating that all chirp mass PDFs are unimodal with similar shape.  The mass ratio distributions however, have larger varaice, and span across most of the prior range.
