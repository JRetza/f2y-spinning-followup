\label{fig:sky} Cumulative fractions of events with sky localization areas smaller than the abscissa value. Top: sky area of $50\%$ credible region $\mathrm{CR}_{0.5}$ Middle: sky area of $\mathrm{CR}_{0.9}$. Bottom: searched area $A_\ast$. The high-latency results including spin are indicated by the solid (blue) line. The lower latency non-spinning and \textsc{bayestar} from \citet{Singer_2014} are denoted by thicker (green) and thinner (orange) lines, respectively. The $68\%$ confidence intervals for the cumulative distribution are denoted by the shaded areas.
