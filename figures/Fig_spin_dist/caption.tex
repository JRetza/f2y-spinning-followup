\label{fig:distance} Cumulative fractions of events with luminosity-distance credible intervals (divided by the true distance) smaller than the abscissa value. Left: Scaled $50\%$ credible interval $\mathrm{CI}^{D}_{0.5}/D_\star$. Right: Scaled $90\%$ interval $\mathrm{CI}^{D}_{0.9}/D_\star$. Results using the spinning analysis are indicated by the solid (blue) line and the results using the nonspinning analysis \citep{Berry_2015} are indicated by the dashed (green) line. The $68\%$ confidence intervals are denoted by the shaded areas.
