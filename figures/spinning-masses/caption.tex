\label{fig:mass_pdfs} Superimposed posterior probability density (top) and cumulative density (bottom) functions for the chirp mass and mass ratio of all spinning analyses.  The solid and dashed lines show the ensemble-averaged and simulated distributions, respectively.  The chirp-mass distributions have been centered on the distribution means, to show more clearly the variance in posterior shape.
