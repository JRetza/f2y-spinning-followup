Superimposed posterior probability density (top) and cumulative density (bottom) functions for the chirp mass and mass ratio of all spinning analyses.  The think lines show the ensemble-averaged distribution of each parameter.  The chirp mass distributions have been centered on the distribution means, to show more clearly the variance in posterior shape.
