\label{fig:mass_pdfs} Superimposed posterior probability density (top) and cumulative density (bottom) functions for the chirp mass and mass ratio of all spinning analyses.  The solid lines show the average distribution for the simulated population.  The chirp-mass distributions have been centered on the distribution means to highlight their consistency in shape.
