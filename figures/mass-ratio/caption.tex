\label{fig:restricted_priors} Cumulative distributions of the lower $90\%$ credible bounds on the estimated mass of the least massive binary components under increasingly strict prior assumptions about maximum NS spin.  Restricting spins to be below break-up ($\chi\lesssim0.7$) for non-exotic equations of state has little effect, as does restricting spin to the maximum observed NS spin ($\chi\lesssim0.4$).  Only strict prior assumptions on NS spin will significantly impact mass constraints.
