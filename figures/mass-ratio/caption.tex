Posterior mass ratio estimates.  (Top) All 250 posterior estimates from the spinning analysis, superimposed.  The red line shows the ensemble-averaged PDF, and the thick gray line shows the distribution of injected systems. (Bottom) The effect of restricting the spin prior on the mass ratio estimates.  Restricting spins to be below break-up ($a\lesssim0.7$) has little effect on mass estimated, as does restricting spin to the maximum observed NS spin ($a\lesssim0.4$).
