Posterior mass ratio estimates.  (Top) All 250 posterior estimates from the spinning analysis, superimposed.  The red line shows the ensemble-averaged PDF, and the thick gray line shows the distribution of injected systems. (Bottom) Ensemble-averaged PDFs for increasingly strict priors on spin magnitudes.  Restricting spins to be below break-up ($a\lesssim0.7$) has little effect, as does restricting spin to the maximum observed NS spin ($a\lesssim0.4$).
