\label{fig:wall-time} Distribution of wall-times (per event). The left (orange--red) distribution is for low-latency sky localization with \textsc{bayestar}; the middle (green) distribution is for medium-latency non-spinning parameter estimation (performed with \textsc{LALInference\_nest}), and the right (blue) distribution is for low-latency fully spinning parameter estimation (performed with \textsc{LALInference\_MCMC}). The \textsc{bayestar} results assume parallelization across $64$ cores (wall-time scales inversely with the number of cores), and both \textsc{LALInference} results assume $2000$ posterior samples (the wall-time is approximately proportional to the number of samples).
