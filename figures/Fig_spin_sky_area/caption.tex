\label{fig:sky} Cumulative fractions of events with sky-localization areas smaller than the abscissa value. Left: Sky area of $50\%$ credible region $\mathrm{CR}_{0.5}$ Right: Sky area of $\mathrm{CR}_{0.9}$. The high-latency results including spin are indicated by the solid (blue) line. The lower latency non-spinning and \textsc{bayestar} from \citet{Singer_2014} are denoted by thicker (green) and thinner (orange) lines respectively. The $68\%$ confidence intervals for the cumulative distribution are denoted by the shaded areas.
