\label{fig:mass_std} Fractional uncertainty in chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c}$, mass ratio $q$ and total mass $M$ estimates from the non-spinning and spinning analyses.  The mean fractional uncertainties from the non-spinning analysis are $0.0185\%$, $8.93\%$ and $0.542\%$ for chirp mass, mass ratio and total mass respectively.  These are a factor of a few smaller than found from a spinning analysis ($0.0676\%$, $28.7\%$ and $6.15\%$ for chirp mass, mass ratio and total mass respectively).
