Standard deviation of chirp mass estimates from the non-spinning and spinning analyses.  The consistency of the non-spinning analyses using both the frequency-domain non-spinning model, and the spinning time-domain model constrained to have no spin, show systematic differences between waveform models don't affect standard deviation estimates.  Accounting for degeneracy between mass and spin estimates results in less certainty in both chirp mass and mass ratio.
