Standard deviation of chirp mass and mass ratio estimates from the non-spinning and spinning analyses.  The consistency of the non-spinning analyses using both the frequency-domain non-spinning model, and the spinning time-domain model with $\chi_1=\chi_2=0$, shows systematic differences between waveform models do not affect statistical uncertainties in the mass estimates.  Thus, the larger uncertainties in mass estimates usind the spinning model are due to degeneracies between mass and spin, and not systematics between waveforms.
