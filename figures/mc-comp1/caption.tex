\label{fig:mass_std} Fractional uncertainty in chirp mass and mass ratio estimates from the non-spinning and spinning analyses.  The mean fractional uncertainties from the non-spinning analysis are $0.0185\%$ and $8.93\%$ for chirp mass and mass ratio, respectively.  These are a factor of a few smaller than found from a spinning analysis ($0.0675\%$ and $28.7\%$ for chirp mass and mass ratio).
