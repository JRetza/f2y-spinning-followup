\label{fig:spinPDF} One-dimensional marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of spin magnitudes of the more and less massive components ($\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, respectively) for all $250$ simulated sources. Except for a handful of signals, the posteriors have very consistent morphology and span the majority of the prior range.  The spin of the most massive component is typically slightly more constrained toward low values, but even a maximal spin of $\chi_1 = 1$ is rarely ruled out.
