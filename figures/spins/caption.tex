\label{fig:spinPDF} One-dimensional marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) for the estimated spin magnitudes of the more and less massive components, $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, respectively. Except for a handful of simulations, the posteriors have very consistent morphology and span the majority of the prior range.  The spin of the most massive component is typically more tightly constrained toward low values, but even maximal spin of $\chi_1 = 1$ is rarely ruled out.
