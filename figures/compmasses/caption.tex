\label{fig:comp_masses} Approximate $90\%$ credible regions for the component-mass estimates of $5$ selected simulations from the spinning analysis; each region is the projection of a rectangular region of chirp-mass--mass-ratio space, bounded by the central $90\%$ credible interval in chirp-mass and upper $90\%$ credible interval in mass-ratio. Circles indicate the true masses of each simulation, and bars indicate the lower bounds of the upper $90\%$ credible intervals (i.e.\ the $10$th percentiles) on mass ratio for increasingly strict prior assumptions on the maximum spin of NSs.
