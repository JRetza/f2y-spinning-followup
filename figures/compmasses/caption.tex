\label{fig:comp_masses} Approximate 90\% credible regions for the component-mass estimates of $5$ selected simulations from the spinning analysis.  Circles indicate the true masses of each simulation, and bars indicate the lower $90\%$ credible boundary (i.e.\ the $5$th percentile) on mass ratio for increasingly strict prior assumptions on the maximum spin of NSs.
