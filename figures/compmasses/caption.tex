The 90\% credible regions for the component-mass estimates of 25 randomly selected events from the spinning and non-spinning analyses.  Circles indicate the true masses of each simulation.  The top and bottom curves of each region are defined by the upper and lower bounds of the chirp mass 90\% credible interval, a line of fixed chirp mass, bounded above and below by the limits of the mass ratio
