\section{Introduction}

As we prepare to enter the advanced-detector era of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) astrononmy, it is critical that we understand the abilities and limitations of the analyses we are prepared to conduct.  Of the many predicted sources of GWs, binary neutron star (BNS) coelescences are paramount; their progenitors have been directly observed, and the advanced detectors will be sensitive to their GW emmission up to 400 Mpc away \cite{2013arXiv1304.0670L}.

Many studies have focused on the BNS parameter estimation abilities of ground-based GW detectors \cite{Nissanke_2010,Nissanke_2011,Aasi_2013,Hannam_2013,Rodriguez_2014,Singer_2014}.
