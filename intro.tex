\section{Introduction}

As we prepare to enter the advanced-detector era of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) astrononmy, it is critical that we understand the abilities and limitations of the analyses we are prepared to conduct.  Of the many predicted sources of GWs, binary neutron star (BNS) coelescences are paramount; their progenitors have been directly observed, and the advanced detectors will be sensitive to their GW emmission up to 400 Mpc away \cite{2013arXiv1304.0670L}.

Numerous studies have looked at the BNS parameter estimation abilities of ground-based GW detectors. \citet{Nissanke_2010,Nissanke_2011} assessed localization abilities on a simulated non-spinning BNS population.  \citet{Aasi_2013} demonstated the ability to characterize non-spinning BNS signals using spinning waveforms, and Bayesian parameter estimation (PE) tools in the \textsc{LALInference} library (CITE).   \citet{Hannam_2013} use appoximate methods to quantify the degeneracy between spin and mass estimates using spin-aligned models.  \citet{Rodriguez_2014} simulated a collection of loud, non-spinning BNS signals in several mass bins and quantified parameter estimation capabilities in the advanced-detector era using non-spinning models.  Finally, \citet{Singer_2014} completed an (almost) complete end-to-end simulation of BNS detection and characterization during the first two years of the advanced detecor era, simulating an astrophysically motivated population of BNS signals that were then detected and characterized using the tools that will be deployed to do so in the coming years.  This study is the final step of BNS characterization using the \citet{Singer_2014} simulations: full characterization of the BNS sources that accounts for the spin of the neutron stars.
