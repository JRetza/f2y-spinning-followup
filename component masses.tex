Figure \ref{fig:comp_masses} compares the $90\%$ credible regions in component-mass space of $25$ randomly chosen simulated signals \citep[cf.][figure 1]{Chatziioannou_2014}.  Since the simulated population had very low spins ($\chi < 0.05$), the assumption that NSs have no spin is almost consistent.  If BNS systems turn out to have appreciable spins, however, it is evident that making strong (and wrong) prior assumptions about NS spin can drastically bias mass estimates.
