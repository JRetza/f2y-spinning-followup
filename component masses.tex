Figure \ref{fig:comp_masses} projects 25 randomly chosen mass distributions from Fig. \ref{fig:mass_pdfs} into the component mass plane.  To do so, a box is constructed in $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c}$--$q$ space, bounded above and below in each dimension by the bounds of the 90\% credible interval.  The box is then pojected into the $m_1$--$m_2$ plane.  The distributions from a non-spinning analysis are also included for comparison.
