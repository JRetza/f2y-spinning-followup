Finally, we look at the posterior PDF as a function of the component masses.  Figure \ref{fig:comp-masses} shows the projections into component-mass space of boxes in $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{c}$--$q$ space, bounded by the one-dimensional 90\% credible interval boundaries.  The region in component mass space is bounded above and below by curves of constant chirp mass, and on either side by the uncertainty in mass ratio.
