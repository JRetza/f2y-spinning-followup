\section{Simulated Sources and Selection}

We have restricted our simulation to the first year of the advanced detector era, using the 2015 dataset from \cite{Singer_2014}.  For this dataset, Gaussian noise was generated using the `early' 2015 LIGO noise curve found in \cite{Barsotti:2012}.  Approximately 50,000 BNS sources were simulated with component masses uniformly distributed between 1.2 and 1.6 $M_\odot$.  Spins were isotropically oriented, with magnitudes $\chi = c |\mathbf{S}|/G m^2$, where $|\mathbf{S}|$ is the neutron star's spin angular momentum and $m$ its mass, were drawn uniformly between 0 and 0.05.  The range of simulated spin magnitudes was chosen to be consistent with the observed population of BNS systems, currently bounded by PSR J0737-3039A \cite{Burgay_2003,Brown_2012}.

From this simulated dataset, detected sources were selected using the \textsc{gstlal\_inspiral} matched-filter detection pipeline\cite{Cannon_2012}.
